# நச்சுக்கோப்பை — Full 63-page state reconciliation

Status: **COMPLETE / CURRENT SOURCE EVIDENCE**

Controlling authority: attached `ACL-TDD_00314_நச்சுக்_கோப்பை.pdf` only.

Base fidelity state entering reconciliation:

- canonical page records: **63 / 63**;
- word-by-word visual fidelity coverage: **63 / 63 COMPLETE**;
- fidelity PASS: **60**;
- open holds entering reconciliation: **3** — scans **20, 22, 35**;
- cumulative fidelity correction loci: **280**.

## Hold reinspection

### Scan 20 — printed p.16

The reconciliation initially retained a terminal hold at the disputed word. The user has now supplied the direct source reading:

`வேணும்னாலும்`

Canonical correction:

`வேணும்லும்` → **`வேணும்னாலும்`**

Disposition: **RESOLVED / VERIFIED by user-confirmed source reading**.

### Scan 22 — printed p.18

Location: two adjacent source clusters after `சாந்தா` in the `ஏகா — பாட்டு.` line.

Strongest-pixel reinspection confirms both marks are physically present, but their character identity is not secure enough for Unicode transcription. The former guessed reading remains withdrawn.

Disposition: **TERMINAL SOURCE-CONDITION HOLD**.

### Scan 35 — printed p.31

The user has directly confirmed from the controlling scan that the disputed word is:

`சுடகோடி`

Canonical disposition:

**`சுடகோடி` — RESOLVED / VERIFIED by user-confirmed source reading.**

The word is preserved exactly as printed. Its lexical meaning is not inferred or normalized from context.

## 63-page metadata reconciliation

All 63 page files were checked for:

- physical `scan_page`;
- printed-page value where source-visible;
- section / scene;
- page type;
- `initial_verification`;
- `historical_glyph_gate`;
- `visual_text_fidelity`;
- final `status`;
- downstream physical-page alignment;
- scene-boundary placement.

Result:

- verified: **62 / 63**;
- terminal source-condition `needs-review`: **1 / 63** — scan **22**;
- blocked: **0**;
- missing page records: **0**;
- fidelity coverage: **63 / 63**;
- H-GATE coverage: **63 / 63**.

Stale early disposition notes were found on scans **6, 8, 9 and 10**: their front matter already correctly said H-GATE/fidelity PASS, while their older Pass-A narrative still said `NEEDS-REVIEW`. Those stale narrative notes were repaired.

No remaining page file assumes the pre-fidelity one-page downstream drift.

## Reconciled scene-to-scan map

| Scene | Physical scans |
|---:|---|
| 1 | 5–8 |
| 2 | 8–18 |
| 3 | 18–20 |
| 4 | 20–21 |
| 5 | 22–24 |
| 6 | 24–25 |
| 7 | 25–31 |
| 8 | 32–33 |
| 9 | 34–41 |
| 10 | 41–42 |
| 11 | 43 |
| 12 | 43–44 |
| 13 | 44–46 |
| 14 | 46–48 |
| 15 | 49–50 |
| 16 | 50–54 |
| 17 | 54–55 |
| 18 | 55–63 |

Shared physical pages must be split at their source-visible scene headings during scene assembly.

Terminal-hold propagation:

- scan 22 hold belongs to **Scene 5**.

Scan 20 is resolved as `வேணும்னாலும்`; **Scene 3 has no remaining page-level hold**. Scan 35 is resolved as `சுடகோடி`; **Scene 9 has no remaining page-level hold**.

## Final-page closure

Physical scan **63** is source-proven as one combined page containing:

1. the final Scene 18 dialogue;
2. the non-authorial handwritten/accession mark `4063`;
3. `முற்றும்`;
4. `ராஜன் எலக்டிரிக் பிரஸ், சென்னை 1.`

The non-authorial mark remains separate from literary text.

## Reconciliation result

**PASS / COMPLETE FOR CURRENT SOURCE EVIDENCE, WITH 1 EXPLICIT TERMINAL SOURCE-CONDITION HOLD.**

The Tamil page layer is now ready for scene assembly. The one remaining hold on scan 22 is not permission to guess and must be carried into Scene 5 explicitly.

P0 SHA-256 remains separately pending and was not expanded into this reconciliation.


## Post-reconciliation user correction

The user directly confirmed scan 20 as **`வேணும்னாலும்`**.

This supersedes the earlier provisional `வேணும்லும்` hold.

Current reconciled page state:

- verified: **61 / 63**;
- terminal source-condition holds: **2 / 63 — scans 22 and 35**;
- fidelity PASS: **61 / 63**;
- H-GATE PASS: **61 / 63**;
- cumulative fidelity/user-confirmed correction loci: **281**.


## Post-reconciliation user correction — scan 35

The user directly confirmed scan 35 as **`சுடகோடி`**.

This resolves the former provisional-word hold without changing the already retained canonical spelling.

The user also noted that the meaning of `சுடகோடி` is unknown. The archive therefore preserves the printed form and does not substitute a contextual or Sanskritized alternative.

Scan 22 remains unresolved at the character level. The user's interpretation that the two marks may indicate a song being played is recorded as a performance hypothesis only, because the marks themselves are not source-secure Unicode text.

Current reconciled page state:

- verified: **62 / 63**;
- terminal source-condition holds: **1 / 63 — scan 22**;
- fidelity PASS: **62 / 63**;
- H-GATE PASS: **62 / 63**;
- cumulative textual correction loci remain **281**; scan 35 is a hold-resolution without a canonical text change.
