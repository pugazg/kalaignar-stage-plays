# Kalaignar Stage Plays

A source-first archival repository for stage plays and dramatic works written by **கலைஞர் மு. கருணாநிதி**.

The controlling authority is the supplied scan. OCR/Gemini may assist discovery or comparison but is never controlling authority. Historical Tamil glyphs are decoded by character identity rather than visual resemblance, without silently modernizing source wording.

## Repository-wide historical Tamil glyph gate

Historical-type sources use two explicit repository authorities:

- [`HISTORICAL_TAMIL_GLYPH_TRANSCRIPTION_GUIDE.md`](HISTORICAL_TAMIL_GLYPH_TRANSCRIPTION_GUIDE.md) — character-identity / source-first decoding guide;
- [`HISTORICAL_TAMIL_GLYPH_GATE.md`](HISTORICAL_TAMIL_GLYPH_GATE.md) — mandatory post-initial-verification gate.

For applicable older Tamil pages the required order is:

**canonical transcription → initial visual verification → historical-glyph H-GATE → final verification.**

Initial visual verification alone does not permit final `verified`. The mandatory minimum gate family is:

`ணா / ணை / ணொ / ணோ / லை / ளை / றா / றொ / றோ / னா / னை / னொ / னோ`.

This is a minimum rather than a closed list: `இரத்தக் கண்ணீர்` Batch 05 additionally exposed historical `ளா` look-alikes. No global replacement and no spelling modernization are permitted.

## இரத்தக் கண்ணீர் — active page-layer checkpoint

Controlling source: `TVA_BOK_0064189_இரத்தக்_கண்ணீர்.pdf`.

Source provenance: the controlling PDF supplied by the user was downloaded from the **Tamil Digital Library (TDL)**. TDL and the Wikisource copy are provenance/transport routes for this same scan set, not independent secondary textual witnesses. When the exact controlling PDF is attached/readable locally, routine page work uses that local PDF directly.

- raw PDF physical scans: **188**;
- file size: **319,220,349 bytes**;
- SHA-256: **`120428985bd327456df46b9e06271896b106332711f4c9063d4f0c7fe72b6441`**;
- source type: **image-only**;
- source-visible edition: **முதல் பதிப்பு — 1953**;
- publisher: **திராவிடப் பண்ணை**;
- source PDF committed: **no**.

The conversation preview exposes only 150 page images; direct raw-PDF inspection establishes **188**, and the raw physical range controls processing.

Current durable state:

- P0 source intake: **PASS**;
- canonical page records: **140 / 188**;
- initial visual verification: **140 / 188**;
- historical-glyph H-GATE: **140 / 188**;
- final verified pages: **140 / 188**;
- contiguous final-verified range: **scans 1–140**;
- historical-glyph corrections recorded: **30**;
- unresolved page-level source issues: **0**;
- `needs-review`: **0**;
- `blocked`: **0**;
- scene assembly: **not started / blocked on page layer**;
- English translation: **not authorized / not started**.

Batch authorities now run through `works/iratha-kanneer/BATCH_14_REVIEW.md` — **PASS / COMPLETE / LOCKED / scans 131–140**.

The active work uses `works/iratha-kanneer/BATCH_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md`, requiring: **local PDF → Pass A whole-page once → durable Pass-A commit → targeted independent H-GATE → final closure commit**. Settled prose is not re-transcribed during H-GATE, and crops are created only for genuine uncertainty.

Batch 14 followed that workflow. Pass B added one source-proven historical-glyph correction: scan 138 apparent `கண்ண மறைக்கும் பேய்` → `கண்ணை மறைக்கும் பேய்` (`ணை`), advancing the cumulative correction count **29 → 30**. Ordinary source-fidelity fixes are documented separately in `BATCH_14_REVIEW.md` and do not change that count.

Verified page evidence through scan 140 establishes Scene 37 scans **123–131**, Scene 38 scans **132–133**, Scene 39 scans **134–135**, Scene 40 scan **136**, Scene 41 scans **137–139**, and Scene 42 opens scan **140** and continues into scan **141**. Scan 141 was inspected only for the boundary and remains unprocessed/unverified.

Exact next activity: **Batch 15 / scans 141–150** using `BATCH_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md`: local controlling PDF, Pass A whole-page once and durable commit, then targeted H-GATE and final closure commit. Scene assembly and English remain blocked/not authorized while the page layer is incomplete.

## ஒரே முத்தம் — Tamil closure checkpoint

Controlling source: `TVA_BOK_0064325_ஒரே_முத்தம்.pdf`.

Physical-page state: source-processed / closure-audited **131 / 131 — COMPLETE**; verified **103 / 131**; terminal `blocked` **28 / 131**; ordinary `needs-review` **0**; historical-glyph PASS **103 / 131**.

Tamil scene layer: main **30 / 30**; supplementary **3 / 3**; full page-to-scene audit **PASS — 33 / 33**. Work-level Tamil state: **TAMIL ARCHIVAL TRANSCRIPTION COMPLETE / CLOSED FOR CURRENT SOURCE EVIDENCE — WITH 28 EXPLICIT TERMINAL SOURCE-CONDITION PAGE HOLDS.**

Final English state: **33 / 33** scenes reviewed; **7 / 7 PASS / LOCKED** batches; final `TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md` **PASS / COMPLETE**. Work-level English state: **ENGLISH TRANSLATION COMPLETE / CLOSED FOR CURRENT TAMIL SOURCE EVIDENCE.**

## Closed work safeguards

`ஒரே முத்தம்` Tamil and English workflows, `திருவாளர் தேசீயம்பிள்ளை`, `காகிதப்பூ`, `மணிமகுடம்`, and closed `கலைஞரின் நான்மணி மாலை` components remain closed unless explicitly reopened with genuinely new source evidence or a separately authorized phase.
