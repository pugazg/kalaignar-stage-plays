## Batch 01 durable findings

- scans 1–10 were directly inspected from the controlling attachment;
- scan 1 cover transcription is source-secure and ordinary visual verification PASS;
- scans 2–10 have conservative partial records only; no uncertain body wording was guessed;
- dramatic printed pagination: scan 5=p.1, 6=p.2, 7=p.3, 8=p.4, 9=p.5, 10=p.6;
- structural correction: **scan 8 contains the close of Scene 1 and the opening of Scene 2**;
- `BATCH_01_SOURCE_INSPECTION.md` records this partial checkpoint;
- the user has now supplied a first-pass transcription, so the next step is **comparison repair**, not retranscription from scratch.

## Exact next activity

1. run independent **Batch 07 H-GATE — scans 61–63** using only the attached PDF;
2. preserve all Batch 01–06 unresolved scans as durable holds without looping reduced renders;
3. promote only source-secure Batch 07 pages to verified;
4. after Batch 07 H-GATE, perform a work-level reconciliation of all 63 page states and decide whether unresolved pages should remain needs-review or receive a terminal source-condition disposition before scene assembly;
5. SHA-256 remains a separate P0 fingerprint hold;
6. do not begin scene assembly or English translation until that reconciliation is committed.

## Closed work safeguards

All previously closed works remain closed unless separately authorized or genuinely stronger source evidence appears.
