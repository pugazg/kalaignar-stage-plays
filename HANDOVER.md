## Batch 01 durable findings

- scans 1–10 were directly inspected from the controlling attachment;
- scan 1 cover transcription is source-secure and ordinary visual verification PASS;
- scans 2–10 have conservative partial records only; no uncertain body wording was guessed;
- dramatic printed pagination: scan 5=p.1, 6=p.2, 7=p.3, 8=p.4, 9=p.5, 10=p.6;
- structural correction: **scan 8 contains the close of Scene 1 and the opening of Scene 2**;
- `BATCH_01_SOURCE_INSPECTION.md` records this partial checkpoint;
- the user has now supplied a first-pass transcription, so the next step is **comparison repair**, not retranscription from scratch.

## Exact next activity

1. continue the user-directed **word-by-word visual text fidelity audit**;
2. process exactly **5 physical scans per iteration**;
3. next range: **scans 11–15**;
4. compare every visible publication-text token, speaker label, stage direction, punctuation and numeral against the attached PDF;
5. make only source-proven corrections; retain unresolved words without guessing;
6. commit immediately after the five-page batch;
7. postpone full 63-page state reconciliation until fidelity coverage reaches 63/63;
8. do not begin scene assembly or English translation.

## Closed work safeguards

All previously closed works remain closed unless separately authorized or genuinely stronger source evidence appears.
