Policy: this is a **secondary published translation witness**, not authority for the Tamil archival text. Do not use it to silently alter Tamil readings. When translation work eventually begins, collate it against the completed verified Tamil transcription, preserve translator choices separately, and respect copyright rather than committing the scanned English book or reproducing it extensively.

## Page-map state

`indexes/page-map.md` records scans 1–6 individually as `verified`. Remaining Anna-foreword startup range is now `7–9`.

## Exact checkpoint

Scans **1–6 are complete and verified**. No dramatic body page has yet been transcribed.

## Next activity

1. Process **scan page 7**, continuing the Anna foreword.
2. Preserve every source-supported spelling, punctuation mark and paragraph break.
3. Use enlarged/native scan inspection where small type is uncertain.
4. Continue sequentially through scans 8–9 only after each preceding page is visually checked.
5. Expand `indexes/page-map.md` one scan at a time.
6. Do not assemble scenes yet.
7. Do not begin English translation yet; retain the published English volume only as a documented future witness until the Tamil archival text is complete and audited.
