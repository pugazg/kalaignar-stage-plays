# CURRENT CHECKPOINT — நச்சுக்கோப்பை / BATCH 02 PASS A COMPLETE

- SHA-256: **PENDING** — sole P0 byte-fingerprint hold;
- source type: **image-only / no usable parsed text layer**;
- provenance: **attached PDF downloaded from Tamil Digital Library; Wikisource carries the same scan/copy**;

- page records created: **20 / 63**;
- full canonical records: **20 / 63** (scans 1–20);
- partial records in Batch 01: **0**;
- user-supplied first-pass baseline: **ingested for scans 1–10** at `works/nachuk-koppai/first-pass/BATCH_01_USER_TRANSCRIPTION.md`;
- Batch 01 Pass A: **COMPLETE — 10 / 10 initial verification PASS**;

- Batch 02 Pass A: **COMPLETE — scans 11–20 / 10 of 10 initial verification PASS; H-GATE pending**;
- scene assembly: **not started**;
- English translation: **not started**.

## Batch 01 durable findings

- scans 1–10 were directly inspected from the controlling attachment;
- scan 1 cover transcription is source-secure and ordinary visual verification PASS;
- scans 2–10 have conservative partial records only; no uncertain body wording was guessed;
- dramatic printed pagination: scan 5=p.1, 6=p.2, 7=p.3, 8=p.4, 9=p.5, 10=p.6;
- structural correction: **scan 8 contains the close of Scene 1 and the opening of Scene 2**;
- `BATCH_01_SOURCE_INSPECTION.md` records this partial checkpoint;
- the user has now supplied a first-pass transcription, so the next step is **comparison repair**, not retranscription from scratch.

## Exact next activity

1. run targeted independent **Batch 02 H-GATE for scans 11–20** using only the attached PDF;
2. preserve Batch 01 unresolved scans **3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10** as open holds; do not loop them without better attached-source readability;
3. retain first-pass readings wherever Batch 02 source pixels remain ambiguous;
4. promote only clean Batch 02 pages to verified;
5. do not create a Batch 02 final PASS unless all ten scans close;
6. SHA-256 remains a separate P0 fingerprint hold;
7. do not begin scene assembly or English translation.

## Closed work safeguards

All previously closed works remain closed unless separately authorized or genuinely stronger source evidence appears.
